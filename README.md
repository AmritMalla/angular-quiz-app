# HUE - Music Quiz

You may also want to have a look at
[gulp-ng2-relative-path](https://github.com/fabianweb/gulp-ng2-relative-path),
which was created just for this project.  

More documentation will be added once we've decided for a good structure. For now please take a look at how to get the app running within seconds:

# Quickstart

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:fabianweb/hue.git
$ cd hue
$ npm install -g gulp typings
$ typings install
$ npm install
$ gulp build
$ npm start
```
